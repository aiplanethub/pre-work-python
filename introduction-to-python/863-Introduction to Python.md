## What is Python?

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It gained prominence owing to its simplicity and ease of use. Its syntax is very similar to english language.

It is an open source free for use tool and has a vast community that contributed over 70K+ libraries. These rich set of libraries makes coding easy for developers and data scientists. Often libraries replace long codes with fewer lines of code.

### Important Guideline

* **Never memorize code!**
* Below is the response for the question **“Do we need to memorize code?”**

## Why Python for Data Science?

* Free and open source
* Great community
* Plenty of libraries for Data Science & Machine Learning
* Easy and intuitive to use

**Note:**

* Data Science is not about programming languages/tools such as Python, R, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, etc
* Data Science is about using the above tools and techniques, and, if required, inventing new tools and techniques, to solve a problem using “data” in a “scientific” way.

## Interactive Notebooks

* We are humans and always need user-friendly applications.
* Notebooks are typically used by data scientists for quick exploration tasks and easy-to-use interactive data science environments.

### Google Colab - Online Environment to Run Python Code

  * Google colab is the simplest way to setup an interactive notebook environment to perform your data science tasks.
  * The environment offers you up to 12 GB RAM/GPU etc for free and 100 GB storage.
  * You don’t need to worry about installing a bulky python application on your laptop/computer
  * **Link to access Google colab:** [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com)

In case you are opening the video on YouTube, you may _**start from 24 secs and watch till 3 mins 10 secs**_ (rest will be covered later)

There seems to some issue with visibility in the video with print function. Print function is usually used as follows print(z)  However, in the video it appears to be print.(z). due to screen recording  issue, so please use the correct one, i.e., print(z).
