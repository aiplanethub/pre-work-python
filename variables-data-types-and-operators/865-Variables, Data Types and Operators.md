## Comments in Python

* When writing code in Python, it's essential to ensure that your code can be easily understood by others, say by your friend who wants to see your code.
* Python ignores everything after the hash mark and up to the end of the line. You can insert them anywhere in your code!
* A shortcut for adding comments is by using CTRL + /

## Operators

* Operators perform simple additions, comparisons, etc., on variables and values.
* Python supports the following types of operators. We will be looking at some of the commonly used operators.

### Arithmetic Operators

Using Python, we can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

Example:\
\
x = 2\
y = 3\
x +  y # addition\
x \* y  # multiplication

### Comparison Operator

* These are used to compare two values
* Gives a Boolean result (True/False)

## Variables

* A variable can be considered as a storage container for data.
* Every variable will have a name.
* It is a good way to store information while making it easy to refer to that information in our code later.

* For instance, instead of working with the number 3.14, we can assign it to a variable pi and use it as many times as we want in our code (wherever required).

* The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

* The syntax for assigning values to a variable is as follows: Variable name = value or information.

* Example: 
  * x = 5 
  * y = "John"
