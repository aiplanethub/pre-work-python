* You know by now Python is a programming language. Now, what is Anaconda?

* Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python. It makes it easy to run Python code on your laptop/computer.

* **Again, why Anaconda?** - Well, we are humans and always want user-friendly applications. And that's what Anaconda does for you. It offers a powerful tool called "Jupyter notebook," an easy-to-use and interactive Python environment for data science.
