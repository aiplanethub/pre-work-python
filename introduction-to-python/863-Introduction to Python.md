## What is Python?

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It gained prominence owing to its simplicity and ease of use. Its syntax is very similar to the English language.

It is an open-source, free-for-use tool with a vast community that contributed over 70K+ libraries. This rich set of libraries makes coding easy for developers and data scientists. Often libraries replace long codes with fewer lines of code.

### Important Guideline

* **Never memorize code!**
* Below is the response to the question **“Do we need to memorize code?”**

## Why Python for Data Science?

* Free and open source
* Great community
* Plenty of libraries for Data Science & Machine Learning
* Easy and intuitive to use

**Note:**

* Data Science is not about programming languages/tools such as Python, R, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, etc
* Data Science is about using the above tools and techniques and, if required, inventing new tools and techniques to solve a problem using “data” in a “scientific” way.

## Interactive Notebooks

* We are humans and always need user-friendly applications.
* Data scientists typically use notebooks for quick exploration tasks and easy-to-use interactive data science environments.

### Google Colab - Online Environment to Run Python Code

  * Google Colab is the simplest way to set up an interactive notebook environment to perform your data science tasks.
  * The environment offers you up to 12 GB RAM/GPU for free and 100 GB storage.
  * You don’t need to worry about installing a bulky python application on your laptop/computer
  * **Link to access Google Colab:** [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com)

### Getting Started Video to Run Python Code on Colab

In case you are opening the video on YouTube, you may _**start from 24 secs and watch till 3 mins 10 secs**_ (rest will be covered later)

There seems to be some issue with visibility in the video with the print function. The print function is usually used as print(z). However, in the video, it appears to be print.(z). due to a screen recording issue, so please use the correct one, i.e., print(z).
